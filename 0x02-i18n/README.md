# i18n
* "i18n" stands for "internationalization."
* It's a term used in software development to describe the process of designing and preparing software applications to be easily adapted for various languages and regions without any structural changes to the codebase.
* The number "18" in "i18n" represents the 18 letters between "i" and "n" in the word "internationalization."
* Internationalization involves making a software application capable of handling different languages, character sets, currencies, date and time formats, and other regional differences.
* This process typically involves separating text from the source code, using external resource files or databases to store text strings, and ensuring that the application's interface and functionality can accommodate different languages and cultural conventions.
* By internationalizing an application, developers can create a framework that allows for easy localization, the process of adapting the application for specific languages or regions.
* Localization involves translating text, adjusting date and time formats, and customizing other aspects of the application to suit the target audience's cultural preferences.
